NEWS for Cardinal package
-------------------------

Version 0.5 [2013-11-8]

- Added image coregistration for 3D sections.

Version 0.4 [2013-11-7]

- Added 'summaryPlot' method for segmentation visualization.
- Exposed 'calibrateSegmentation' method to calibrate colors
	between multiple MSImageSegmentation objects.
- Added more thorough verbose output for 'spatialSparseCluster'
	and 'spatialSparseKMeans' methods.
- Improved behavior of 'intensities' method when reconstructing
	complex datacubes and with non-contiguous pixel requests.
- Changed 'trellisImage' to plot all coordinates for dimensions
	omitted from 'fixCoord' by default.
- Minor changes to the 'MSImageSegmentation' class structure.
- Improved 'likPlot' method and added AIC and BIC results and
	the resulting number of classes.

Version 0.3 [2013-7-5]

- Improved speed of imaging processing (smoothing and interpolation)
	methods for use with 'image' and 'trellisImage'.
- Added option for verbose output and hooks for GUI progress bars.
- For prediction on 'MSImageSegmentation' objects, 'autoDimNames'
	is now automatically passed along from the original call.
- Changed 'MSImageSegmentation' to an S4 class derived from 'list'.
- Added option for plotting the probabilities of an 'MSImageSegmentation'
	using overlaid transparency masks for improved visualization.

Version 0.2 [2013-6-20]

- Package renamed from internal code-name "Canary" to "Cardinal".
- Split off GUI to a new package called "CardinaliView".
- New GUI in "CardinaliView" now based on gWidgets and RGtk2.
- Added slot 'peaks' to 'MSImageSet' class.
- Changed 'MSPeakFrame' and 'MSPeakList' to S4 classes, and added
	new class 'MSPeak Alignment'.
- Changed how the 'estimateNoise' method estimates noise.
- Changed options in the 'detectPeaks' method to be more useful.
- Changed the 'alignPeaks' methods to align to the mean spectrum
	as a reference when aligning a list of peaks.
- Added 'interpolate' option for images.
- Fixed bug where plotting mass spectra for multiple pixels fails
	on datasets with missing mass spectra.
- Fixed bug where the 'unload' method did not remove the object.
- Added new method "selectPeaks" for manual peak selection.
- Modified the 'type' arguments in the plotting methods.
- Fixed bug in the 'crossValidate' method where the dots arguments
	were not passed to the 'predict' method.
- Changed 'crossValidate' method to now return predictions for the
	full dataset for every fold instead of the test set only.

Version 0.1 [2013-6-6]
- First internal release for Stanford Canary Center for Cancer
	Early Detection as primary beta testers.
- Implementation of MSImageSet S4 class; mass spectra are stored as a
	flat matrix with rows as features and columns as pixels; original
	data cube can be reconstructed dynamically using a position array;
	spectra stored using environments to prevent redundant data copying.
- Visualization that includes plotting ion images and mass spectra,
	using both base graphics and lattice graphics, allowing trellis
	display of multiple ion images and multipe mass spectra.
- Pre-processing for that includes normalization, baseline correct,
	peak-picking, peak-alignment, resampling, and binning.
- Multivaritate statistical analysis includes PCA, PLS, and OPLS.
- Supervised analysis includes a spatially-aware version of nearest
	shrunken centroids, PLS-DA, and OPLS-DA.
- Unsupervised analysis includes spatially-aware clustering based on
	nearest shrunken centroids, and an implementation based on sparse
	k-means.
- GUI based on tcltk using rpanel that supports all major
	processing and statistical analysis methods in the package,
	except for PLS and OPLS.
