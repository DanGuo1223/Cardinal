TODO for Cardinal package
-------------------------

- rewrite selectROI() and selectPixels() and selectPeaks()
- fix behavior of 'sample' in IAnnotatedDataFrame ('dim' or 'sample' labelType?)
- need better behavior with combine() in SImageData for Hashmat elements
- rewrite spatial clustering and classification methods
- rewrite PCA/PLS/OPLS methods
- add plotting of analysis results to plot() and image() methods
- add options to plot() and image() methods (line type, orientation, etc.)
- add smoothing and interpolation and contrast enhancement to image()
- have readImzML parse processingData (need to write C++ functions)
- add writing of imzML and Analyze formats (requires digest+uuid)
- write documentation for missing methods (pixelNames, etc.)
- clean up constructors with better annotatedDataFrameFrom methods
- add optical image support
